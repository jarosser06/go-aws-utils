# go-aws-utils
CLI utilities written in go using aws go sdk

Makes use of a go routine and WaitGroup in order to get faster execution time against all 12 normal public aws regions.

## instancelist

Currently outputs the following (print skips empty regions):

```
Oregon                  us-west-2 : 2   
Instance ID      State        OS         Type               VPC          Subnet        Public IP        Private IP       Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i-xxxxxxxx      running      Linux     t2.micro        vpc-xxxxxxxx  subnet-xxxxxxxx   xx.xx.xx.xx      172.31.20.191                                  
i-xxxxxxxx      running      Linux     t2.micro        vpc-xxxxxxxx  subnet-xxxxxxxx   xx.xx.xx.x       172.31.20.224    test      
```

This should eventually go into awsresources as a switch, but good coding is hard and I needed the original version of this much faster.

## awsresources

Currently outputs the following:

* Snet = Subnets
* CD = CodeDeploy
* CF = Number of Cloudformation stacks

Rest should e fairly obvious
